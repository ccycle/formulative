## Build and Execution

- Get a list of the available binaries:

  ```
  cabal list-bin all:exes
  ```

- Build single binary:

  ```
  cabal build <exec_name>
  ```

  To reduce binary size, use `--enable-executable-dynamic` (build may fail if shared libraries has been changed):

  ```
  cabal build <exec_name> --enable-executable-dynamic
  ```

- Build all binary:

  ```
  cabal build all
  ```

- Execute:

  ```
  cabal exec <exec_name>
  ```

  To use command line arguments, put `--` after `exec`:

  ```
  cabal exec -- <exec_name> <args>
  ```
