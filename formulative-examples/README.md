## Build and Execute

- Get a list of the available binaries:

  ```
  cabal list-bin all:exes
  ```

- Build single binary:

  ```
  cabal build <exec_name>
  ```

- Build all binary:

  ```sh
  cabal build all
  ```

- execute:

  ```sh
  cabal exec <exec_name>
  ```

  To use commandline arguments, put `--` after `exec`:

  ```sh
  cabal exec -- <exec_name> <args>
  ```
