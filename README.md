# formulative

`formulative` is an open-source package for polymorphic numerical simulation. It provides unified syntax for mathematical operations and data export appliable to multiple types such as scalar, vector, matrix, and data type combining these types.

Examples are in [formulative-examples](formulative-examples).

## Setup

If GHC is not installed on your system, use GHCup (https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) and install GHC, cabal, HLS, and stack (HLS and stack are not necessary to build package, but useful for development).

## Build
